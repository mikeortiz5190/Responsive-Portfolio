    <p class="bio"> Hi! My Name is Michael Ortiz, I'm a mechanical engineer at Florida Stainless Fabricators
        currently working as a design engineer. I graduated form UCF back  in August 0f 2016 and have since
        aquired a strong interest in programming most notably in web develpment. Besides my strong interest in
        engineering and technology, I do enjoy things like taveling, sports, and meeting new people. I've always
        had a nack for learning new skills and trying to better myself since knowledge really is power.
        I was also a reservist in the Marines with one combat deployment under my belt, and very honored to have
        served.
<br/>
           I consider myself very fortunate to be in the coding and I hope to make a career from this in the near future!
